Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave 
notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

/*
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code.
Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.
