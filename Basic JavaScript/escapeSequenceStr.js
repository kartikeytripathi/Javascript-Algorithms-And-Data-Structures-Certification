/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping 
characters: First is to allow you to use characters you might not otherwise be able to type out, such as a backspace.
Second is to allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean

Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

    FirstLine
        \SecondLine
    ThirdLine

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";
