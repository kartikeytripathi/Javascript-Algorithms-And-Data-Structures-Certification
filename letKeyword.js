/***************************************************************************************************************
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can overwrite variable 
declarations without an error.

var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
// logs 'David'
As you can see in the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James and then overridden to be David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might 
accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite.

Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.

let catName;

  "use strict";

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!";
